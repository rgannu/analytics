-- REPLICA IDENTITY is a PostgreSQL specific table-level setting which determines the amount
--   of information that is available to logical decoding in case of UPDATE and DELETE events.
-- FULL - UPDATE and DELETE events will contain the previous values of all the tableâ€™s columns.
--   This is needed so that tables with no PK/toast columns are updated with previous values
--   during the processing of the UPDATE WAL message.
